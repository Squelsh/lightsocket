A lightweight ZeroMQ socket server for the JVM (written in Jython for now)


What is Lightsocket?

Lightsocket is a lightweight ZeroMQ socket server for the JVM. I originally 
wrote it to provide a way for Bulbs to plug into the JVM becasue I needed
to load WordNet from NTLK (which is in Python) into the Ne4j Batch Loader
(which is in Java). But, it's generic enough that you can use can add 
resource modules to extened it to do whatever you want.

An Example resource is provided in lightsocket/resources dir, as well as a 
Blueprints resource.
 
Is it ready?

It works for what it was designed for, but it's not meant to be used as a 
production server (at least not yet). I will continue to develop it and 
use it to experiment with ZeroMQ and binary protocols. 

It's written in Jython so it's easy to extend, and it was doing ~8,400 inserts 
per second on a single external USB hard drive on my dev system. Jython and
JSON were the bottlenecks. By using a binary serialization library and 
rewriting the server in Java or Scala we could improve upon that.

What do I need?

If you're just using the base server, you need several to install these 
packages (I plan on automating this real soon now):

* ZeroMQ (http://www.zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software)

* jzmq, the Java ZeroMQ binding (install using maven):

  $ git clone https://github.com/zeromq/jzmq.git
  $ cd jzmq
  $ mvn clean install

* Jackson JSON (http://jackson.codehaus.org/)

* Google Gson (http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/)

If you are going to use for Neo4j/Blueprints or to load WordNet, you also need:

* Bulbs (http://bulbflow.com)

* Blueprints (https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints)

* Rexster (https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki)

Where are the docs?

These are the docs at the moment, and resoruces/example.py is an annotated for you.

You will need to edit startup.py and init.py, which are located in the root dir.

Soon I will put up real docs and more examples at http://lightsocket.bulbflow.com .

Where can I get help?

The Gremlin User group (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gremlin-users)
of email me at james@jamesthornton.com.

Please feel free to fork it and send me pulls if you hack on it, and it needs a maven
install script so it would be cool if someone set that up.
